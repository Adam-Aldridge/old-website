                    <b>Abstract</b><br>
                    When chemotherapy treatment is administered, sensitive cancer cells are killed but more resistant species
are left to grow and multiply. Evolution by forced selection is occurring in diseases all over the world. In the
following dissertation, two discrete-time branching process models are formulated and analysed to develop
understanding of drug resistance dynamics. Then, a continuous time, Moran style lattice model is proposed
for the simulation of tumor growth, in which, the Gillespie algorithm is enlisted to manage realisations of
175 individually defined event types. Finally, the lattice model is used in an implementation of the genetic
algorithm to display adaptivity.

                    <h1>BSc Project Report: Sudoku Solving in Python (2018)</h1>
                    <b>Abstract</b><br>
                    The aim of this project was to write a program that is able to solve Sudoku puzzles with pen
and paper style methods. In this report, a variety of Sudoku solving methods will be explored in
detail. Then it will be explained how these methods were programmed in Python and combined to
solve Sudokus. The program is capable of solving square Sudokus of any size, although for some
that are bigger than the traditional 9 by 9 this can take a significant amount of time. It is able to
find the single solution of any uniquely solvable Sudoku puzzle. The program can also find every
solution to Sudokus which have more than one.
